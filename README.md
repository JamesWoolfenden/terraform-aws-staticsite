Terraform module to provision a secure Terraform S3 bucket as a static website.

---

It's 100% Open Source and licensed under the [APACHE2](LICENSE).

## Usage

Include this repository as a module in your existing terraform code:

```hcl
module "static" {
  source              = "JamesWoolfenden/staticsite/aws"
  version             = "0.3.1"
  common_tags         = var.common_tags
  permitted_ip_ranges = var.permitted_ip_ranges
  s3_bucket_name      = var.s3_bucket_name
}
```

## Module Usage

This creates an s3 bucket with policy and applies the common tags scheme.
The module uses a tagging scheme based on the map variable common*tags.
This needs to consist of as a minimum(in your \_terraform.tfvars*):

```HCL
common_tags = {
    application = "terraform"
    module      = "staticsite"
    environment = "develop"
}
```

## Checkov

I have added a number of exceptions to this module:

```markdown
#checkov:skip=CKV_AWS_52: "Ensure S3 bucket has MFA delete enabled"
#checkov:skip=CKV_AWS_19: "Ensure all data stored in the S3 bucket is securely encrypted at rest"
#checkov:skip=CKV_AWS_21: "Ensure all data stored in the S3 bucket have versioning enabled"
#checkov:skip=CKV_AWS_20: "S3 Bucket has an ACL defined which allows public READ access."
#checkov:skip=CKV_AWS_18: "Ensure the S3 bucket has access logging enabled"
```

They relate to private usage and not website - public usage.

## Testing

This module is validated and built and destroyed with every version.
